# Hi, I’m Emigbanam Uwuitaisuk

I’m a data enthusiast sharpening my skills in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI**.  
I build, experiment, and learn by doing.  

---

## What I Do

- I explore datasets using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
- I build regression, classification, and predictive models  
- I apply feature engineering, preprocessing, model evaluation  
- I document my work in **Jupyter Notebooks**

---

## What I’ve Built (Sample Projects)

Here are a few recent projects that show what I work on:

| Project | What I Did |
|---|---|
| **Car-Price-Prediction-Model** | Created a regression model to predict car prices. Used historical car listing data (brand, gearbox, fuel type, etc.). |
| **DVD-Rental-Duration-Prediction** | Used regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict how long DVDs are rented based on features. |
| **Bank-Customer-Survey-EDA** | Exploratory Data Analysis on survey data from bank customers. Demographics, reliability checks, profiling. |
| **ML-Projects**, **Machine-Learning-Practice**, **PythonData-Science-Practice-Repository** | Various mini-projects, practice exercises, experiments with supervised & unsupervised methods, data visualization, model tuning. |
