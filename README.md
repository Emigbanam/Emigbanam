# Hi, Iâ€™m Emigbanam Uwuitaisuk ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer** with a background in **engineering and design**.  
I enjoy turning raw data into insights, building predictive models, and solving problems with code.  

On GitHub, youâ€™ll find my journey through:  
- Exploratory data analysis projects  
- Machine learning experiments (regression, classification, clustering)  
- Practice notebooks where I learn, fail, and improve  
- End-to-end projects tackling real-world questions  

Iâ€™m especially interested in:  
- Machine Learning & AI applications  
- Time series forecasting  
- Natural Language Processing  
- Smart data visualization  

Outside of data, I enjoy teaching, reading, and engaging in meaningful conversations about technology and society.  


## What Iâ€™ve Built (Sample Projects)

Here are a few recent projects that show what I work on:

| Project | What I Did |
|---|---|
| **Car-Price-Prediction-Model** | Created a regression model to predict car prices. Used historical car listing data (brand, gearbox, fuel type, etc.). |
| **DVD-Rental-Duration-Prediction** | Used regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict how long DVDs are rented based on features. |
| **Bank-Customer-Survey-EDA** | Exploratory Data Analysis on survey data from bank customers. Demographics, reliability checks, profiling. |
| **ML-Projects**, **Machine-Learning-Practice**, **PythonData-Science-Practice-Repository** | Various mini-projects, practice exercises, experiments with supervised & unsupervised methods, data visualization, model tuning. |
